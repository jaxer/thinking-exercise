## Installation

    pip install -r requirements.txt

## The "service":

Run with:

    twistd -y service.py --pidfile service.pid --logfile service.log

Stop with:

    kill $(cat service.pid)

Logs are in ```service.log```

It will start daemon on port 8080 and export two resources:

    http://127.0.0.1:8080/service/method
    http://127.0.0.1:8080/callback.service/method

Any arguments to `service/method` will be forwarded to corresponding backend service (see `The "backend"`).
Backend method URL is hardcoded to be:

    http://localhost:8081/backend-service/method

## The "backend":

Run with:

    twistd -y backend.py --pidfile backend.pid --logfile backend.log

Stop with:

    kill $(cat backend.pid)

Logs are in `backend.log`

It will start a daemon on port 8081 in foreground and export one resource:

    http://127.0.0.1:8081/backend-service/method?delay=5

"delay" is optional, specifies number of seconds until backend will do a POST to callback url.
Callback url is hardcoded to be:

    http://localhost:8080/callback.service/method

## Sample requests

###### Success

    http://127.0.0.1:8080/service/method

Will immediately produce correct output, i.e:

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    {"timestamp": "2015-10-17T19:31:37.889072", "response": "dummy data for request f4403754-c6cc-41ba-a8ed-aebaf7fc515d"}

###### Timeout or backend unavailable

    http://127.0.0.1:8080/service/method?delay=10

Any delay bigger than 5 (hardcoded TIMEOUT value) would result in:

    HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable
    Response took longer than 5 sec, cancelled. Please try again later.

If backend is not running or unreachable, then any requests would produce something like:

    HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable
    Backend failed with: Connection was refused by other side: 61: Connection refused.

###### Error

    http://127.0.0.1:8080/service/method?delay=xyz

Specifying non-integer value for delay would make backend fail:

    HTTP/1.1 502 Bad Gateway
    Backend failed with: Delay is not a number

## Performance

On my MacBook Pro, its something around 320 requests per second with 50 threads concurrency.
Transport turnaround time ranges from 50 to 500 ms.

Memory usage never exceeds 25 mb per process.
